The purpose of this library is to provide easier to understand access to more
complex MySQL query strings. Debugging complex query strings inside of PHP can
often times become a nightmare. This library helps to simplify this by using
built in PHP data types for pushing and pulling information from MySQL tables.

The 'mysql_fetch_assoc' function inside of PHP returns an associative array,
with the keys being the MySQL column names, and the values being the MySQL
table values. The functions of this library mimic this same methodology, and
expand it to support many more query types.
